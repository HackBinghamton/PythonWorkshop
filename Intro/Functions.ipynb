    "In math if we have a function f(x)=x+4, then we compute f(2)=2+4=6. In other words, we have some input, which is 2, and after doing some operations using that input,  we will produce an output, which is 6. Similary, in Python, a function carries out a certain task. Often times the function takes some input used to eventually produce an output or do something with the input. However, a function doesn't have to take input. There are certain functions that are included in Python such as `print()`. You also have the ability to make your own function. The proper syntax to create a function is `def function_name():`, and then the code you want the function to do will be indented.\n"

    "Python also has tons of built in functions that you can use! For example, one of the most common ones that you have already used is `print()`. This function takes the items that you want to print to the screen and handles everything involved with this task. Other examples include `len(x)`, which gives the length of x(x can be a string, list, dictionary, etc.), `pow(x,y)`, which gives x to the power of y, `type()`, which returns the type of a variable, and `sorted(x)`, which sorts a list x in ascending order. All of Python's built in functions can be seen [here](https://www.programiz.com/python-programming/methods/built-in). Run the code below to see some examples"
