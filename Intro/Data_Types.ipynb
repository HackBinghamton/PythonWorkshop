    "Note About Division: when you divide numbers in Python, the result will always be a float to ensure the accuracy of the quotient (since division sometimes results in floating point or decimal numbers). If you want to be sure that you'll get an ineger when you divide you can use Python's *integer division* feature. To use it, replace the `/` with `//` and the result will always be an integer (as shown in the integer division example above). But beware, Python will not round up, it will simply remove the decimal point and use the whole number that remains.\n",

    "\n",
    "Note About Modulo: modulo seems like a scary operator, but it's not. It can actually be pretty useful. All it does is compute the remainder that's left over when you divide two numbers. When the two numbers you divide are multiples of each other (say `3` and `6`, for example), the remainder is `0`. This means that modulo is super useful for finding out if numbers are multiples of each other. The most common example is checking to see if a number is even. To be even our number must be divisible by `2`, in other words the number has to be a multiple of `2`. So to find out if a number is even, all we have to do is check if our number modulo `2` equals `0`. For instance, `4 % 2` will equal `0`, therefore `4` is an even number! Meanwhile `7 % 2` will equal `1`, which is not `0`, and therefore `7` is not even!"
