Welcome to the introduction section! In this section, you'll cover:

1. [Data Types and Variables](https://colab.research.google.com/github/HackBinghamton/PythonWorkshop/blob/master/Intro/DataTypesAndVariables.ipynb)
2. [Printing and Input](https://colab.research.google.com/github/HackBinghamton/PythonWorkshop/blob/master/Intro/Printing_and_Input.ipynb)
3. [Control Flow](https://colab.research.google.com/github/HackBinghamton/PythonWorkshop/blob/master/Intro/ControlFlow.ipynb)
4. [Functions](https://colab.research.google.com/github/HackBinghamton/PythonWorkshop/blob/master/Intro/Functions.ipynb)
5. [Imports](https://colab.research.google.com/github/HackBinghamton/PythonWorkshop/blob/master/Intro/Imports.ipynb)

If you have past programming experience, check out this [quick guide](https://colab.research.google.com/github/HackBinghamton/PythonWorkshop/blob/master/Intro/programmingKnowledge.ipynb) for learning Python with a programming background!

And tie it all together through an [exercise](https://colab.research.google.com/github/HackBinghamton/PythonWorkshop/blob/master/Intro/Exercise.ipynb)!

Once you've completed this section, check out the [intermediate section](https://github.com/HackBinghamton/PythonWorkshop/tree/master/Intermediate)!
