    "\n",
    "Object-Oriented Programming (otherwise known as OOP) is a useful (and awesome!) programming paradigm \"which provides a means of structuring programs so that properties and behaviors are bundled into individual objects\" (quote from [here](https://realpython.com/python3-object-oriented-programming/)). These objects usually represent real-life objects which can be modeled with code. Some common examples are BankAccount, Animal, or Shape.\n",

    "## How does it work in Python?\n",
    "\n",
    "Objects are represented in Python by a handy-dandy feature called a *class*. Classes look something like this!"
