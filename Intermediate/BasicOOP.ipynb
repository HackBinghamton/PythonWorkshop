    "\n",
    "Object-Oriented Programming (otherwise known as OOP) is a useful (and awesome!) programming paradigm \"which provides a means of structuring programs so that properties and behaviors are bundled into individual objects\" (quote from [here](https://realpython.com/python3-object-oriented-programming/)). These objects usually represent real-life objects which can be modeled with code. Some common examples of objects you might find in tutorials are `BankAccount`, `Animal`, or `Shape`.\n",

    "## How does it work in Python?\n",

    "## Okay, but why does this matter?\n",
    "\n",
    "If you've only learned how to code this decade, you've probably always been using object-oriented principles. It thus may seem like objects, while useful, are an arbitrary stylistic choice. This is not the case.\n",
    "\n",
    "When Alan Kay created Smalltalk in the 1970s, the language pushed forward the concept of object oriented programing to the extent that nearly every modern language can be considered to have been directly inspired by Smalltalk. \n",
    "\n",
    "### What was so revolutionary about Smalltalk/OOP?\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Abstraction:** All programming languages use abstraction from a machine programmers perspective -- the print function, for example, is really triggering an extremely complicated process involving hundreds of lines of code and a framebuffer. Smalltalk, however, like languages before it did with modules, allowed users the ability to create their own abstractions, in a more condensed way than modules had permitted. These class functions, in addition to making the code more comprehensible, prevent the need to repeat code.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Inheritance and Polymorphism:** Using classes, we can create objects that have similar or exact functions and properties without rewriting those functions. Inheritence and polymorphism are covered in the Advanced section of this workshop.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Communications Protocol:** While the concept of OOP has been slightly altered from this by modern languages such as C and Python, in its original form, OOP objects were not data structures, but groups of functions. Thus while you could communicate with the object by calling functions, you could not learn about its internal state. With Python, you can use and reference your class variables to see your objects internal state, but your main method of communication should still be functions."
