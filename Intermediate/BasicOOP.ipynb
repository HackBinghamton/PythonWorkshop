    "Object-Oriented Programming (otherwise known as OOP) is a useful (and awesome!) programming paradigm \"which provides a means of structuring programs so that properties and behaviors are bundled into individual objects.\" (https://realpython.com/python3-object-oriented-programming/). These objects usually represent real-life objects which can be modeled with code. Some examples are BankAccount, Jacket, and Animal.\n",
    "\n",
    "## How does it work in Python?\n",
    "\n",
    "Objects are represented in Python by a handy-dandy feature called a *class*. Classes look something like this!"

    "Object-Oriented Programming is a really useful way to think about code, because it allows you to build your code in a way that models real life. This often allows you to break down complicated ideas into actions. And, with features like inheritance, it makes sure you're keeping your code DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself).
