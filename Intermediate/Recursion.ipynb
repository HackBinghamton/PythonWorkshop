    "Recursion is a technique where a function returns a function call to itself to create a loop.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why is it useful?\n",
    "\n",
    "Recursion is a method of solving problems based on the \"divide and conquer\" mentality.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can use recursion to take the original problem and divide it into smaller (easier) instances of itself, solve those smaller instances (usually with same algorithm again) and then reassemble them into the final solution. Recursion works well with solving problems that are defined in terms of themselves."

    "\n",
