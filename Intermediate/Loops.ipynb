    "## For Loops\n",

    "For loops are used when you know exactly how many times you want your loop to run.\n",

    "\n",
    "2. **range(10)** tells our loop how many times to run. Changing the number in the () changes how many times it will run.\n",

    "\n",
    "2. We're printing out **x** now instead of \"Hello\". What this means is that x is going to start out at the first value in our range, 0, and at the end of every loop it will increase by 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Our range is 21 because we want to print all of the numbers up to 20. Since our loop starts at 0, range(20) would only take us to the number 19. So we have to loop 21 times to get numbers 0 through 20.\n",

    "While loops are used when we don't know how many times our loop needs to run.\n",

    "While loops rely on one single boolean expression, which is an equation that will evaluate to either True or False. As long as that expression evaluates to True, the loop will continue. Once it evaluates to False, the loop ends.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case, our boolean expression is `x != \"q\"`. If the user's input, which is stored in our variable x, is not q then the expression will be True. If it is q, the expression will be False and the loop will stop.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each time the loop iterates, the user inputs something and it is stored in x. The loop then checks if their input is q and either loops again or stops.\n",
    "\n",
    "The reason we use a while loop in this situation is that we don't know when the user is going to input q. They could input q before the loop even starts, or they could never input q at all.\n",
    "\n",
    "The most important part of using a while loop is making sure that your boolean expression will at some point be False. If it is always True and never changes, then your loop will be infinite (a very bad thing). An example of an infinite loop would be:"
