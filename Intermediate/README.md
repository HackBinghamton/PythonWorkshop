# Intermediate Python

In this section, you'll cover:

1. [Loops](https://colab.research.google.com/github/HackBinghamton/PythonWorkshop/blob/master/Intermediate/Loops.ipynb) - Repeat things in your code automatically with loops.
2. [Collections](https://colab.research.google.com/github/HackBinghamton/PythonWorkshop/blob/master/Intermediate/Collections.ipynb) - Learn to use Lists and Dictionaries.
3. [String Manipulation](https://colab.research.google.com/github/HackBinghamton/PythonWorkshop/blob/master/Intermediate/StringManipulation.ipynb) - Learn to do handy things with text data.
4. [Comprehensions and Ternary Operators](https://colab.research.google.com/github/HackBinghamton/PythonWorkshop/blob/master/Intermediate/ComprehensionsAndTernaryOperators.ipynb) - Write more with less by using comprehensions and ternary operators.
5. [File Input and Output](https://colab.research.google.com/github/HackBinghamton/PythonWorkshop/blob/master/Intermediate/FileIO.ipynb) - Make your programs interact with files on your computer.
6. [Basic Object Oriented Programming](https://colab.research.google.com/github/HackBinghamton/PythonWorkshop/blob/master/Intermediate/BasicOOP.ipynb) - Learn how to organize your code with Classes.
7. [Recursion](https://colab.research.google.com/github/HackBinghamton/PythonWorkshop/blob/master/Intermediate/Recursion.ipynb) - Solve problems by making your functions call themselves.

And tie it all together with a [project](https://colab.research.google.com/github/HackBinghamton/PythonWorkshop/blob/master/Intermediate/IntermediateProject.ipynb)!
