    "What is a CLASS? Classes are simply a way to bundle data and functionality together. Creating a new class creates a new TYPE of object, allowing new INSTANCES of that type to be made. Each class instance can have attributes attached to it for maintaining its state. Each class instance can also have methods attached to it for modifying state.\n",
    "\n",
    "Multiple names (in multiple scopes) can be bound to the same object. This is often known as aliasing. Since aliases behave like pointers in some respects, passing objects is cheap. This also means that if a function modifies an object passed as an argument, the caller will see the change. Consider the example below:"

A SCOPE is a textual region of a Python program where a namespace is directly accessible. \"Directly accessible\" means an unqualified reference to the name attempts to find the name in the namespace. For example, example1.maximize is the full qualified name, whereas maximize is the unqualified name. When a program is trying to resolve a name, it searched in the following order: innermost scope (local names) -> scopes of enclosing functions (non-local, but non-global names) -> next-to-last scope (current module's global names) -> outermost scope (built-in names).\n",
