    "## LRU Cache for Function Calls\n",
    "### Intro to Memoization\n",
    "**Memoization** is the caching of function calls for recursive programs. Caching function calls significantly speeds up a program because accessing a value in a cache is significantly less expensive than recomputing it.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is an LRU Cache?\n",
    "A **L**east **R**ecently **U**sed cache of size `n` stores values for speedy retrieval until it reaches capacity. When the user tries to insert an uncached value to a full LRU cache, the cache selects the least recently accessed value and replaces it with the new value.\n",
